Aim to pull data from FishBase APIs and display via two activities.

This occurs in two stages:

1) Display a search bar. Entering text will query the first API to populate a list of text
search results, eg:
    http://www.deepspaceweb.com:80/fishbase/api/cname/letter/dwarf%20rasbora
This returns an `autocr` value, that can be used when an item is selected.

2) When an item is selected, use its `autocr` value to query a separate API:
    https://fishbase.ropensci.org/comnames?autoctr=20863 - Returns a "Species Code" from "autoctr"
    https://fishbase.ropensci.org/species/10879/ - Returns more data from Species Code
This will return more detailed information.

3) For images, explore the possibility of using an image search API (Flickr maybe?)
