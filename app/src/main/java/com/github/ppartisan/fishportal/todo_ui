App should be in two possible states.

1) A Search bar at the top and RecyclerView underneath. The RecyclerView will live-update its results
based on entries in the search bar.

2) Selecting an item from the search results will launch a new screen that contains more detail
on the selected item, including an image-pager/interactive toolbar at the top.
